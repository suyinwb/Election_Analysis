1. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
1. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
1. Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
1. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total.
1. Determine the county with the highest turnout.

### Resources

## Appendix
The following is writing method using the Analytics Paradigm

### Purpose
see  [Background --> Overview of Project](#background) and [Challenge Summary](#challenge-summary)

## Methodology: Analytics Paradigm

#### 1. Decomposing the Ask
Using election results dataset to determine the 8 questions asked above in [Background --> Overview of Project](#background) and the 3 questions in and [Challenge Summary](#challenge-summary)

#### 2. Identify the Datasource
election_results.csv

#### 3. Define Strategy & Metrics
Using Python to read, compute and format output of the requirements into a txt file.

#### 4. Data Retrieval Plan
Use election_results.csv in Python with ```import csv``` and ```file_to_load = os.path.join("resources", "election_results.csv")```

#### 5. Assemble & Clean the Data
Python scripting

#### 6. Analyse for Trends
* 8 questions asked above in [Background --> Overview of Project](#background)
* 3 questions in and [Challenge Summary](#challenge-summary)

#### 7. Acknowledging Limitations
* Limitation of personal knowledge in Python programming
* Using Python, the scripts will run in real-time.

#### 8. Making the Call:
The "Proper" Conclusion is indicated below on [Results](#results)
